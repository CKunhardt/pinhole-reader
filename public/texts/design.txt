    ABSTRACT 
This paper examines the promise of empathy, the name commonly given to the initial phase of the human-centered design process in which designers seek to understand their intended users in order to inform technology development. By analyzing popular empathy activities aimed at understanding people with disabilities, we examine the ways empathy works to both powerfully and problematically align designers with the values of people who may use their products. Drawing on disability studies and feminist theorizing, we describe how acts of empathy building may further distance people with disabilities from the processes designers intend to draw them into. We end by reimagining empathy as guided by the lived experiences of people with disabilities who are traditionally positioned as those to be empathized.

 1 INTRODUCTION

 Understanding users has constituted an important and even radical facet of computing practice and education since before the founding of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) discipline [[22], [50]]. Within HCI and related fields, designers often call activities associated with understanding users ‘empathy-building’ [[27], [99]]. These activities are part of a phase of the design process comprising a range of background research, interviews, and observations [[13], [99]]. Some design professionals credit empathy for supporting positive customer relationships and cultivating a successful business culture (e.g. [[13], [61]). Others highlight the systematic marginalization and low representation of certain people employed in design fields and frame empathy as a useful corrective: transferring experiences of nondesigners to designers in order to shape more inclusive futures [[8], [21],[45]]. In these calls for empathy, the domain of disability represents an especially potent site. Designers use empathy to frame their attempts to understand disabled nondesigners across a range of empathy-building activities, from the observation of people with disabilities to the temporary simulation of bodily impairments [5], [37], [45]].

 In this paper, we examine how empathy, as performed by designers in order to know their users, may actually distance designers from the very lives and experiences they hope to bring near. For example, designers who use disability simulation techniques such as blindfolds to empathize with blind users may not need to consider the user with disabilities; instead, they may focus on their own experience wearing a blindfold. To make this argument, we draw from public accounts and popularized toolkits to describe how designers (as the empathizers) position their work to address the experiences of people with disabilities (as the empathized). Reading this work through recent critiques, we illustrate how designers may privilege their interpretation of the disabled experience over firsthand encounters, a position that further contributes to the prioritizing of normalcy over disability [[38], [66]].

 Responding to and intervening in this design space, we argue for letting go of empathy as an achievement— something to build, model, or reach within design. Instead, we draw from decades of disability scholarship and activism [[20], [33], [48], [49], [51]] to recover empathy as a creative process of reciprocation. Specifically, we suggest that what it takes to “be with” someone should come before what it takes to “be like” someone, a refrain borrowed from feminist theorist Vinciane Despret [[24], [25]] to describe a shift from transferred to shared experiences. In this reworking, we explore how designers may productively grapple with and against empathy by recognizing the range of emotional, political, and historical relationships of which empathy is a part. As Saidiya Hartman, a scholar of African American literature and history, writes of documentation around the Transatlantic slave trade, “it becomes clear that empathy is double-edged, for in making the other’s suffering one’s own, this suffering is occluded by the other’s obliteration” [[39], p. 20].

 Our analysis draws from a growing body of literature examining design’s promise and idealism [[46], [47], [56], [79], [85]] as well as disparate strands of theorizing within disability studies, feminist philosophy, and participatory design (e.g., [[4], [6], [39], [54], [55], [72]]). Our understanding of the term ‘disability’ borrows from Alison Kafer [[48]], who describes how disability arises relationally when people with impairments are not anticipated, producing encounters inaccessible for people with body/mind impairments. Within disability studies, scholars such as Kafer [[48]], Michelle Nario-Redmond [[67]], Arielle Silverman [[83]], and Rebecca Garden [[34]] trouble the practical simulation of bodily impairments and call for more direct interactions with disabled people, without aiming to directly understand their experiences. In parallel, recent feminist scholarship frames empathy as formed within and through people’s connections with others—placing empathy in historical context and implicating it in the uneven distributors of power that further entrench dominant forms of storytelling [[3], [39], [70]]. We thread this thinking through recent accounts of design practice to offer new perspective on the popular empathy-building activities that HCI scholars and practitioners employ today.

 Our project makes three central contributions to recent conversations on disability, empathy, and design methods. First, we show that disability offers a crucial empirical site to expand current HCI conceptions of empathy in ways that reveal important and often unintended consequences of empathy activities such as the simulation of motor impairments with a wheelchair. Second, we show how empathy gets used to diminish disabled perspectives, separate the roles of disabled people and designers, and stage the disabled experience as a spectacle. Lastly, we explore what it might mean to shift understandings of empathy in design from a position that rests on “the ability [to] ‘put oneself in the other’s shoes’” [[70], p. ix]. to one that foregrounds shared experience and historicity.

 In what follows, we first put empathy in historical context. We briefly trace the roots of empathy work in HCI and user-centered design, reviewing in particular the literature around disability and empathy. Attending to the theorizing of feminist scholars (Sara Ahmed [[3], [4]], Vinciane Despret [[24], [25]], Saidiya Hartman [[39]], Carolyn Pedwell [[70]], Anna Tsing [[93]], among others), we then analyze public accounts of empathy around disability shared by a celebrated global design firm. We end by discussing efforts to reimagine empathy as the work of attuning – noticing and realigning different bodies and relationships to one another toward respectful connections. In this sense, our work picks up where Rebecca Garden leaves off in her incisive critique of empathy in the medical profession, examining “the development of sophisticated paradigms of empathy as a means of reframing the discussion of ethics in medical education and in clinical practice” [[34], p. 564]—as well as in the parallel fields of technology design.

 2	WHAT IS EMPATHY?

 Empathy, from the Greek term empatheia meaning em- or ‘in’ and pathos or ‘feeling’, describes the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. Whether championing affective skills or challenging greed, to borrow from Pedwell, “empathy is everywhere and is viewed, by definition, as positive” [[70]].

 To understand this positive valence, we turn to empathy’s roots, a genealogy tied up with earlier vocabulary. Bioethics scholar Rebecca Garden, for example, reports how across the 19th century the terms sympathy and sensibility described the ability to innately partake in another’s suffering and to act toward its relief (within limits) [[34]]. For Enlightenment philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith, she points out, sympathy and sensibility came naturally to certain bodies (those of members of the educated, upper classes), and not to others [[34], [52]]. In the late 1800’s, this concern for sensory capacity resurfaced with empathy’s introduction into the German language [[34], [70]]. According to historian Susan Leigh Foster, the aesthetic theorist Robert Vischer devised the German term Einfühlung (empathy, or “feeling-in”) to explore the process of observing arts such as sculpture [[70], p. 191]. Following this usage, the early 20th century translation of Einfühlung into English referred to the sharing of sensory experiences with other people and objects. The term became particularly salient within traditions of modern dance wherein it described audience members’ physiological and affective immersion alongside performing dancers. This “inner mimicry,” as popular dance critic John Martin called it, represented a subconscious transformation from mere spectator to participant in the dance, unseen by others but very much felt within the body and mind [[52], [70], [76]]. Its meaning contrasts with empathy’s usage within contemporaneous European psychiatry wherein the concept of empathy signaled a solution to over-sympathizing [[52]]. Psychiatrists such as Ludwig Binswanger positioned empathy as a technique of empiricism, using therapeutic interviewing to get at the intangible thoughts and feelings inaccessible by traditional medical instruments while avoiding complete immersion into a client’s thoughts and feelings, ostensibly keeping an empirical distance [[52], [70]]. Across the later decades of the 20th century, this mix of concepts—on the one hand, creating an affective, less fully conscious connection and, on the other hand, developing a removed scientific understanding—formed the activities that have come to characterize empathy in design.

 2.1 Empathy in Contemporary HCI

 While less studied, the roots of empathy in HCI date back as far as 1974, when Koberg and Bagnell articulated the “analyze” stage in their widely circulated volume Universal Traveler [[50]]. Over the next few decades, empathy came to stand for that initial and essential exercise toward “good design,” often elevated as the very “foundation” of the human-centered design process [[27], p. 4]. Such valorization took place not only in HCI research but also in business schools [[23]] and other popular design thinking resources (see, for example, [[8], [12], [43]]) “Find (or create if necessary) ways to immerse yourself in specific environments to understand first hand who you’re designing for,” one popular empathy-building guide suggests [[27], p. 5]. In another celebrated tool called the “empathy map,” designers synthesize intended users’ behaviors, feelings, and thoughts (see [[36]]). This and similar empathizing exercises can serve as justification for subsequent design decisions.

 Turning to empathy in HCI research, several scholars have developed the concept with methods and ethics-oriented contributions [[16], [26], [59], [99]]. In a widely cited 2008 CHI paper, Wright and McCarthy [[99]] identify empathy as an emerging trend within HCI studies involving attempts to more deeply understand and interpret user experiences. Surveying empathy-building activities employed in HCI research, they review a variety of techniques of empirical inquiry: from observations and interviews, to narrative resources comprising diaries and art pieces, to roleplaying with simulations and personas. Across this set, they argue for regular ethical evaluation of empathy-building. For them, empathy marks a commitment to forming relationships and accountabilities (not just understandings). Empathy, in these contexts, occupies a moral stance where it becomes associated with design to uphold social values [[99]].

 2.2 Empathy-Building Around Disability

 Recent design guides frame empathy-building as even more important when users have disabilities [[1], [17], [45], [58]]. By making the assumption that the life experience of disabled people is unfamiliar to designers, such guides suggest that empathy-building offers a way for designers to step into the user’s shoes. From this perspective, elevating empathy constitutes a crucial step towards shifting a designer’s thinking outside themselves.

 Activities for building empathy largely overlap with user research methods. A unique empathy-building method that sensitizes people to difference (racial, gendered, ability) is modeling or simulation. During disability simulation exercises, people who presumably do not have disabilities acquire a temporary bodily impairment with rudimentary tools like blindfolds and gloves to occlude vision and tactile sensations and then complete a daily task with these unfamiliar bodily constraints (for a range of work, see [[5], [17], [29], [40], [53], [57], [58], [67], [69], [73], [77], [83]]). Proponents argue that immersion provides an unparalleled opportunity for designers to bring themselves closer to the experiences of people with disabilities by smoothing out assumed differences with users [[5], [37], [42], [45], [73], [77]]. For example, researchers have created personas with disabilities [[82]] and Microsoft’s Inclusive Design toolkit offers situational impairments [[63], [64]] to bring disability closer to designers. According to the Inclusive Design Manual [[64]], even if impairments are temporary (such as having just one hand free while carrying bags), if a designer can imagine how they, too, are impacted by impairments, the brief connection it spawns between designer and user with disabilities can make the designers see disability differently (e.g., make accessibility guidelines seem more relevant).
 
 2.3 Critiques: Where empathy goes wrong

 A range of recent scholarship has pointed to the ways empathy, and design thinking packages more generally, work as a means of convincing designers that they have superior training and ethical tools to quickly assess and innovate on problems in domains they are unfamiliar with (e.g., [[1],[41],[46]]), a phenomenon Lilly Irani aptly characterizes as the “design savior” complex [[47]]. In a widely circulated critique [[95]], media historian Lee Vinsel likened the empathy phase to a consult with would-be customers wherein designers distill what users want and capitalize on those insights. Other critics locate problems with how empathy directs designers to individual, sensationalized problems when societal transformation is necessary [[14], [60], [68]]. Across these critiques, commentators grapple with how to minimize harm while still reaping the benefits of human contact that inform design.

 Decades of scholarship in rehabilitation and social psychology [[33], [49], [67], [83], [84]], education [[18]], disability studies [[48], [51]], and popular design blogs [[1], [86]] caution certain types of empathy-building around disability. Scholars argue that simulations, an especially controversial empathic modeling activity, reproduce negative stereotypes and fail to highlight infrastructural and social challenges. For example, a designer navigating a food buffet while steering a wheelchair for the first time may foreground a beginner wheelchair operator’s experience but does little to reveal nuances of different contexts, experiences over time, and the myriad factors that impact disability including greater cultural, institutional, and social influences [[48], [67]]. Empathy built through immersion, critics argue, may steer designers toward narrow and inaccurate conceptions of disability experiences.

 Generally agreeing that design cannot be premised on empathy alone, several scholars offer alternative terms (e.g., compassion [[51], [89]], humility [[21]], or noticing [[6]]) along with techniques. Techniques include simulations guided by disabled people [[18], [35], [62], [84], [88]], codesign exercises in which designers enlist disabled people as partners [[32], [35], [71], [87], [94]], and community service work led by disabled people [[20]].

 Pervasive among recent critiques and correctives is a nearly uncontested belief in the power of empathy to provoke more inclusive designs for/with people with disabilities. Feminist cultural studies scholar Carolyn Pedwell describes how “[p]recisely because it is so widely and unquestioningly viewed as ‘good’, [empathy’s] naming can represent a conceptual stoppage in conversation or analysis.” For her, this stoppage involves not “‘what is empathy?’, ‘what does it do?’ or ‘what are its risks?’, but rather the more automatic refrain of ‘how can we cultivate it?’” She sees its unquestioned promise as necessitating further investigation [70].

 Pushing on this concern, scholars of African American literature [39] and Performance Studies [9] question the achievability of empathy related to the valuing and understanding of life. For Saidiya Hartman, for example, the difficulty of empathy involves “the dangers of a too-easy

 intimacy” [[39], p.20] wherein empathy upholds the workings of colonialism and oppression. Hartman and others pluralize empathy—using it as not merely a tool for understanding one another but as a tool rife with the histories, politics, and aims of those working with it. Feminist scholars Sara Ahmed [[3], [4]], Anna Tsing [[93]], and Vinciane Despret [[24], [25]] hold onto this tension between discovery and contamination by showing how empathy can open connections while predisposing the empathized as different and other. Ahmed, for example, contends that “empathy sustains the very difference that it may seek to overcome: empathy remains a ‘wish feeling’, in which subjects ‘feel’ something other than what another feels in the very moment of imagining they could feel what another feels” [[3], p. 30]. Attending to this “wish feeling,” Despret offers visions of feeling with another. Such accountability foregrounds shared experiences over authoritative narratives.

 In what follows, we take to task this need to more deeply understand empathy within the context of disability and design. We use public accounts of empathy to illustrate how activities associated with empathy may turn disability into an unrelatable trait of the ‘other.’ With this argument in mind, we attempt to break through Pedwell’s “stoppage.” As she describes, “When empathy is understood as the experience of ‘co-feeling’, it is suggested, this not only invites problematic appropriations or projections on the part of privileged subjects, it also risks obscuring their complicity in the wider relations of power in which marginalization, oppression and suffering occur” [[70], p. 10].
